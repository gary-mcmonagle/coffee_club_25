This is before a single line of code has been written! 

Some local things to set up


1. Azure MCP: https://github.com/Azure/azure-mcp
This runs via stdio which by the looks of it just uses AZ Cli on your machine


2. Github MCP: https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server 
Authenticated and used to create repo - I guess thats cool

Have created local git repo - Noe lets commit these inital files and see if we can push to that repo via chat
